Code Refactor Homework
This application has been refactored to match the needs of the client. The client requested changes to semantic html and css consolidation. This refactoring project has made the website easier to read and more accessible on the web along with getting rid of some of the excess code. Additional semantic html elements were added to improve search engine optimization.

I learned a lot about how to edit code using critical thinking strategies to see what works best and what does not. I also learned how to use resources. I utilized google MULTIPLE times along with classmates. It was not easy, but I am proud of my accomplishment.
